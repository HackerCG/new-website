This might be the first question in your mind when you visited PentestBox.com, and it is really natural for users to keep using the same thing in which they are comfortable. I completely stand by that thought. But i can list out some reasons which might make you consider using PentestBox once. 
 For the rest of the Blogpost i will refer PentestBox as ptb, ptb is what i normally call it in dicussions, sounds much better right :) 

First of all, let me define ptb. According to official statment,"PentestBox is an Opensource PreConfigured Portable Penetration Testing Environment for Windows Operating System". Errr, what is that ? Okay, let me say in simple words, it let you run all your security tools direclty on windows operating system .

Really ? Yeah.

That sound's cool isn't. There are too many blogpost/videos on porting some or the other tool on windows, because generally a normal user run limited number of tools and he/she wants to run them directly on their operating system. And majority of computers users in world uses windows, around 80%.

Okay now coming to point. Why PentestBox ?

I will try not be biased when i compare Ptb with other pentesting distros, but let me know if i am.


* How many tools do ptb have ? I guess quality matters than the quantity, but still ptb have support for over 200 pentesting tools.
